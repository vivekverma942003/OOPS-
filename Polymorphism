Polymorphism :- When the same class can be treated as different forms then it is known as polymorphism.
 It allows a single entity (e.g., method, object) to take multiple forms
There are two types of Polymorphism in java Compile Time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. 

Method overloading polymorphism: -When there are multiple functions with the same name but different return types or parameters then it is called compile time polymorphism.
Different Parameters:
Overloaded methods must differ in one of the following:
Number of parameters.
Types of parameters.
Order of parameters.




class Car{
    int price;
    String name;
    public Car(int price, String name){
        this.name=name;
        this.price=price;
    }
    
    public void print(){
        System.out.print("This is print");
    }
    public int  print(){
        System.out.print("This is price ");
        return 100000;
        
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Try programiz.pro");
        Car temp= new Car(70000,"Suzuki");
        temp.print();
        temp.print(90);
    }
}


Method overloading does not depend upon the return type..

Method Overriding can be defined as a function which can be used to define the functions that are already defined within the parent class.
with the same , name return type and parameter
