What is OOPS ?
OOps is programming paradigm in which we can be  defined as bunch of objects talking to each other . An object is an entity of the class which contains data and methods which operates on them

CLass :
It can be defined as the users defined data types which can contains multiple data and methods which can modify the data or attributes . 
This can be used as a template or blueprint . 
Example : - Car is an classs with attributes color model name power and methods are start engine close engine shutdown


Objects : - An object is an instance of the class  Car is a class but the specific name and model are given through the class

Encapsulation in java is hiding the complex implementation and showing only necessary implementation to the user
It controls how the data will be controlled and modified
it is implemented by declaring the variable private to restrict direct access from outside the class.
  
Public Getter and Setter Methods:Access to private variables is provided through public methods, called getters and setters. These methods allow controlled access to the internal data.
Data Hiding:
By restricting direct access to an object’s data, encapsulation helps in protecting the object’s state and ensures that it cannot be modified arbitrarily.
